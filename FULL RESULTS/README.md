# CAUPER

Modern computing platforms are highly-configurable with thousands of interacting configurations. However, configuring these systems is challenging. Erroneous configurations can cause unexpected non-functional faults. This paper proposes CAUPER (short for Causal Debugging Toolkit) that enables users to identify, explain, and fix the root cause of non-functional faults early and in a principled fashion. CAUPER builds a causal model by observing the performance of the system under different configurations. Then, it uses casual path extraction followed by counterfactual reasoning over the causal model to: (a) identify the root causes of non-functional faults, (b) estimate the effects of various configurable parameters on the performance objective(s), and (c) prescribe candidate repairs to the relevant configuration options to fix the non-functional fault. We evaluated CAUPER on 5 highly-configurable systems deployed on 3 NVIDIA Jetson systems-on-chip. We compare CAUPER with state-of-the-art configuration optimization and ML-based debugging approaches. The experimental results indicate that CAUPER can find effective repairs for faults in multiple non-functional properties with (at most) 17% more accuracy, 28% higher gain, and 40Ã— speed-up than other ML-based performance debugging methods. Compared to multi-objective optimization approaches, CAUPER can find fixes (at most) 9Ã— faster with comparable or better performance gain. Our case study of non-functional faults reported in NVIDIA's forum show that CAUPER can find 14Ã— better repairs than the experts' advice in less than 30 minutes.

## Run instructions using Jetson faults dataset
To run experiments on NVIDIA Jetson TX1 or TX2 or Jetson Xavier devices please use the 
following command to launch a flask on localhost:
```python
command: python run_service.py softwaresystem
```
For example to initialize a flask app with image recogntion softwrae system please use:
```python
command: python run_service.py Image
```

Once the flask app is running and modelserver is ready then please use the following command
to collect performance measurments for different configurations: 
```python
command: python run_params.py softwaresystem
```

To run causal models for a single-objective bug please run the following:
```python
command: python cadet.py  -o objective1  -s softwaresystem -k hardwaresystem
```
For example, to build causal models using NOTEARS and fci for image recognition software 
system in TX1 with initial datafile irtx1.csv use the following for a latency (single objective) bug : 
```python
command: python cadet.py  -o inference_time  -s Image -k TX1
```

To run causal models for a multi-objective bug please run the following:
```python
command: python cadet.py  -o objective1 -o objective2 -s softwaresystem -k hardwaresystem
```
For example, to build causal models using NOTEARS and fci for image recognition software 
system in TX1 with initial datafile irtx1.csv use the following for a latency and energy consumption (multi-ojective) bug : 
```python
command: python cadet.py  -o inference_time -o total_energy_consumption -s Image -k TX1
```
## Run instructions using a different dataset
If you want to run CAUPER on your own dataset you will only need cadet.py and src/causal_model.py.
To perform interventions using the recommended configuration by cadet.py you need to develop 
your own utilities (similar to run_params.py etc.). In addition to that, you need to
make some changes in the etc/config.yml file based on your need. The necessary steps are 
the following:

### Step 1:
Update init_dir variable in the config.yml file with the location of the initial data.

### Step 2:
Update bug_dir variable in the config.yml file with the location of the bug data.

### Step 3:
Update output_dir variable in the config.yml file where you want to save the output data.

### Step 4:
Update hardware_columns in the config.yml with the hardware configuration options you want to use.

### Step 5:
Update kernel_columns in the config.yml with the kernel configuration options you want to use.

### Step 6:
Update perf_columns in the config.yml with the events you want to track using perf use. If you use any other monitoring tool you need to update it accordingly.

### Step 7:
Update measurment_colums in the config.yml based on the performance objectives you want to use for bug resolve.

### Step 8:
Update is_intervenable variables in the config.yml with the configuration options you want to use and based on your application change their values to True or False. True indicates the configuration options can be intervened upon and vice-versa for False.

### Step 9: 
Update the option_values variables in the config.yml based on the allowable values your option can take. 

At this stage you can run cadet.py with your own specification. Please notice that you also need to update the directories according to your software and hardware name in data directory. 
If you change the name of the variables in the config file or use a new config fille you need to make changes accorsingly from line 49 - 58 in cadet.py.
If you use your own intervention uitility you need to update line 6 and line 126 of cadet.py.
